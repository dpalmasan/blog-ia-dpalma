# Test Scripts

Here I just place some test scripts to be run directly with `npx  ts-node`. You will probably like
to deactivate the `module` attribute from `tsconfig.json` when running this as is. I will fix this 
some day, when I get better at `typescript` and `React`. For now, it is, what it is.

## `TestWumpus.ts`

This script is just to play with diferent `Wumpus World` instances, and if you'd like to test the instance 
in the AI book, you could just do something like `let wumpusWorld = generateWumpusWorld(true)`.
